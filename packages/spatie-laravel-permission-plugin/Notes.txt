- Maybe ask for Super admin during install command
    - if only more than one user is presetn in DB.
- inverse of InstallCommand to clean up afterward.
    - Remove Policies and Truncate Permissions
- Bootable trait to add default filament_user on create
    - taking care of production should user opt in
- Clean up & refactor before release

Current

- Extends Filament:resource command and offers below options:
    - with permissions & policy
    - only permissions & policy
    - with permissions
    - only permissions
    - default resource generation

- RoleResource(Name Should be changed to something else)
    - doesn't register
    - just copies it over so more control to the user
    - generates permissions and policies
    - only one check now, for permissions table.

- Super Admin
    - automatically gets assigned each permission generated
